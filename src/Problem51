Problem Statement:
Rotate a string one step means each word of that string is shifted by one position left and the leftmost word will go to the rightmost position.
You are given a string str and an integer k.
You are required to rotate the string str as mentioned above,
by k steps and print the rotated string.

Note:
If str is empty, print NULL.
If k is 0, print the original string.

Assumption:
Words in string str are separated by a single space.

Input Format:
The input consists of the 3 lines:
The first line contains an integer, i.e. string length of str
The second line contains the string, i.e. str.
The third line contains an integer i.e. the number of steps.
The input will be read from the STDIN by the candidate

Output Format:
The output consists of the rotated string in a single line.
The output will be matched to the candidate's output printed on the STDOUT
