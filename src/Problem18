Problem Statement:
You are given a list of integers,
and your task is to write a function that finds the two numbers in the list that add up to a specific target sum.
You need to return the indices of these two numbers.
Write a function that takes a list of Integers and a target sum as input and
returns a list of two indices (0-based) of the numbers that add up to the target sum.
Assume that there is exactly one solution, and you cannot use the same element twice

Sample Input:
2 7 11 15
9

Sample Output:
[0, 1]
