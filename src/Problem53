Problem Statement:
Write a program to identify whether the given number N is palindrome based upon the following operations:
Add the given number and its reverse.
Check whether the obtained sum after the first operation is a palindrome or not and if not then repeat the above operation.
The given operation will continue until a palindromic number is found.
Print the resultant palindromic number as the output.

Note:
Palindrome: A sequence of letters/characters which reads the same backward and forwards.
A single letter/character is also considered a palindrome.

Input Format:
The input consists of a single line:
The line contains a single integer denoting N.
The input will be read from the STDIN by the candidate

Output Format:
Print the resultant palindromic number for the given input.
The output will be matched to the candidate's output

Sample Input:
28

Sample Output:
121

Explanation:
Reverse of 28 is 82
28+82=110
Reverse of 110 is 011
110+11=121
So 121 is a palindrome.
